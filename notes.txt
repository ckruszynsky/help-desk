Things to try
* track a session for automatic logins, get cookie, set user instance, change root of application.


* aurelia.setRoot() --> uses the convention of app.js & app.html to bootstrap the application. You can override this convention.

* compose --> dynamically creates or composes views or viewModels. 
         * when only providing a view, the html becomes inlined into the view
         * when using without specifying a viewModel; you will be bound against the same viewModel that the view is being referenced in. 
         * allows you to break the view into small composable pieces


* canActivate, canDeactivate
* valueConverters, globalResources, features (configuration)
* plugins
* requires in html
* when using valueConverters in a expression you must use lower Pascal casing when referencing the value converter.

*bonus* --> inject user into dateValueConverter and read the user date preference and use that as the default format.

* creating reusable components like the dialog plugin
* attach-focus ??
* router.navigateToRoute - replace, trigger
* eventAggregator pub / sub
* route-href
* binding behaviors
* creating elements
* TaskQueue - Manages async tasks (micro & macro tasks)
* ProcessContent - custom elements 
* Slots
* children - aurelia-framework --watches child elements of a element and syncs it.
* ref attributes
* for chart example to remove duplication of code you could use the @useView decorator and create a "chart.html" for both the line and bar charts

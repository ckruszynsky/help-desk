Things to try
* track a session for automatic logins, get cookie, set user instance, change root of application.


* aurelia.setRoot() --> uses the convention of app.js & app.html to bootstrap the application. You can override this convention.

* compose --> dynamically creates or composes views or viewModels. 
         * when only providing a view, the html becomes inlined into the view
         * when using without specifying a viewModel; you will be bound against the same viewModel that the view is being referenced in. 
         * allows you to break the view into small composable pieces


* canActivate, canDeactivate
* valueConverters, globalResources, features (configuration)
* plugins
* requires in html
* when using valueConverters in a expression you must use lower Pascal casing when referencing the value converter.

*bonus* --> inject user into dateValueConverter and read the user date preference and use that as the default format.
